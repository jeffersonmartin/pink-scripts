# pink-scripts
Development and sysadmin shell scripts with memorable pink syntax highlighting

The pink-scripts are for development and sysadmin tasks on Mac OS X and Ubuntu linux. Each script can be executed using the terminal by executing the file. If you do not specify any command-line arguments, you will be prompted with a wizard to fill in. You can pass arguments to avoid the wizard for a silent execution using a cron job or executed from another script.

You should open each script before the executing for the first time to set the variables for your environment.
